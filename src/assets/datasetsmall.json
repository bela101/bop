    "abstract": "How do the Germans listen to music nowadays? Survey Musik und Medien 2012 delivers representative data on actual audio media usage of German population. These data allow the comparison of usage frequencies regarding new and old audio media technologies with reference to three separate domains of audio technology use:\nAudio Sources describe distribution channels by which music is purchased, archived and made accessible. The term Audio Devices refers to technical devices that permit access to and enable playback of Audio Sources. Audio Emitters finally comprise those technical objects that are connected to Audio Devices to make the Audio Sources actually audible.",

    "abstract": "We assessed psychometric properties and established normative data for the German Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and analyzed its association with neuropsychiatric factors across the lifespan to provide a validated metamemory assessment for a German-speaking population. The three MMQ scales (memory satisfaction, self-rated ability, and strategy application) were translated into German, considering cultural, linguistic, and conceptual aspects. To validate the MMQ and assess associations with neuropsychiatric factors, the Complainer Profile Identification, Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Short-Form-Health Survey were applied in an online study in 336 healthy participants with follow-up after eight months. Psychometric evaluation of the German MMQ showed normal distribution of all scales and good to excellent validity, internal consistency, and retest reliability. We provide percentiles and normative data for z-score conversion. Importantly, even subclinically elevated scores in depressiveness and anxiety were associated with decreased memory satisfaction and self-rated ability. Furthermore, although the influence of age on the German MMQ scales was minimal, effects of neuropsychiatric factors such as sleep quality, anxiety, and depressiveness on MMQ Satisfaction and Ability varied across the lifespan. Our study provides a validated German translation of the MMQ with normative data and reliability measures, including reliable change scores. We show the impact of neuropsychiatric factors on the MMQ scales across the lifespan and emphasize the relevance of a multifactorial approach to metamemory as a measure of individualized everyday functionality and the importance of including neuropsychiatric factors into both research and clinical assessments of metamemory.",

    "abstract": "  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation\nrelations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has\ngained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck\nscale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric\nsector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of\ninterest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple\ncosmological model.\n",

    "abstract": "  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for\napplications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate\nresponse to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing\nprevious solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were\nfound to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high\naccuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for\ncomposite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock\ninteractions with a planar interface between different materials. These\ncalculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics\nexperiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example\ncalculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects\nof plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and\nshock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.\n",

In particular we present a set\nof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the\nextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss\nthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such\nobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An\nadditional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified\nfrom the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of\nresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with\nthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling\nof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects\nexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with\nactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly\ndebris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends\ndown to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.\nThe lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from\nextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.\nA spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are\nmore highly clustered than the later stages and that the background\nextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function\nas seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches\nbetween several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO\npopulation and our Spitzer data set.\n",

    "abstract": "  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph\ndefined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play\nan important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed\nin the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary\ndimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known\nresults are given.\n  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and\ncontraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes\nfrom old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite\npartial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.\n",

    "abstract": "  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya\nin quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial\nvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\ntime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\nkm/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that\nextend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence\nfor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\nconfirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\npresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\nhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\nouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\nmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\nclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\naccretion curtain model.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential\nequations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth\nfinite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n",

    "abstract": "  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,\nremains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.\nHere we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter\nwavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out\nwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson\nand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to\ndynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look\nfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests\nthat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by\nALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool\ngas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of\nthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\nthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\nsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\nmHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\nperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that\nprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features\nwithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of\nthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.\n",
